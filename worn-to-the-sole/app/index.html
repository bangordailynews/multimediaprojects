     "articleBody": "Worn to the sole, Editor’s note: Maine’s constricting labor force offers an opportunity to pull people into the workforce who otherwise wouldn’t work, and to move lower-paid workers up the job chain into positions that pay more. But the public programs in place to help people improve their job prospects are largely set to autopilot, or they are greatly limited in their reach due to the way they are designed and funded. This is the second in a series called Forgotten Maine Workers that examines how Maine could realize the hidden potential among its workers. ‘Literally nonstop’ Salena Sawtelle needs a new pair of work shoes. From 6:15 a.m. until 2:45 p.m. each day, she walks miles, back and forth through the rooms of the eight elderly residents under her watch at Stillwater Health Care nursing home in Bangor. As a certified nursing assistant, she helps the residents shower, eat and use the bathroom. She changes their diapers, sheets and clothes. She rubs lotion on their 80- or 90-year-old bodies and puts in and takes out their dentures. She helps them out of bed and into their wheelchairs, and out of their wheelchairs and into bed. This is just a fraction of what she does. “It’s literally nonstop,” Sawtelle, 23, said at the end of her shift on Feb. 21. As a result, the insoles of her black work clogs have flattened. Her feet ache. But Sawtelle can’t afford a new pair of shoes, she said. She makes $11.37 an hour, or about $1,600 a month, which is barely enough to cover her monthly rent ($400), car payment ($233), car insurance ($135), phone plan ($45) and other bills. Most weeks she has about $50 left over for everything else, including groceries and gas. The work is so stressful and the pay so low that even though she loves her job — and her supervisors say she has a gift for it — Sawtelle has considered quitting or moving to Massachusetts where the pay is better. Maine cannot afford to lose Sawtelle. She is part of an almost entirely female workforce of nearly 24,000 direct caregivers — those who provide hands-on, long-term care to the elderly and disabled — who will be needed to help Maine’s burgeoning population of seniors age with dignity in the coming decades. Health care on the whole will be Maine’s job engine for the foreseeable future. The two occupations projected to see the most growth in Maine in the next decade are workers at the higher- and lower-paid ends of the health care job spectrum. At the low-wage end, the state is anticipated to need 2,470 new direct care workers — which is the umbrella term for CNAs, personal care aides and home health aides — between 2014 and 2024. Yet at a time when demand for caregivers is at an all-time high, the incentives to do the work are at record lows. Wages have not kept up with inflation over the past decade; high turnover and unfilled vacancies have destabilized the work environment; and there are few opportunities for advancement. At least 45 percent of CNAs who leave their jobs are departing the health care industry entirely, according to a 2012 study in the Journal of Social Science and Medicine. The state legislature has an outsized influence over this segment of the workforce, since most of the funding for long-term care comes from MaineCare, the state’s version of Medicaid. So its lawmakers, not the free market, who largely set the rates that ultimately determine CNA pay and other benefits. Maine policymakers and employers have, essentially, two options. They can do little or nothing, and continue to see tremendous turnover, poor wages and gaps in staffing among direct care workers. Or they can harness the industry’s growth for the betterment of workers by figuring out how to compensate them fairly and turn the profession into a starting point for advancement in the field. “The nature of that work needs close examination. We need to figure out: How do we upgrade these kinds of jobs? Given the enormity of this work in an aging society, with more complications associated with aging, we’ve got to get better at it,” said John Dorrer, former director of the Center for Workforce Research and Information at the Maine Department of Labor. Women are far overrepresented in low-income positions in Maine, and the vast majority of the large and growing direct care workforce is female — 85 percent of all direct care workers and 94 percent of CNAs in nursing homes are women. Boosting wages and conditions in this sector alone could have a substantial effect on the lives of low-income women and their families. Better wages and more opportunities for training and advancement are workplace reforms unions have fought for historically, but only about 10 percent of direct care workers in Maine are unionized, according to Matt Schlobohm, executive director of the Maine AFL-CIO. “Those working in nursing home settings have one of the most demanding, heart-wrenching jobs. And what a slap in the face: You’re taking care of our loved ones, and we can’t even take care of you,” said Traci Place, a business agent with Teamsters Local 340, a union that covers one nursing home in Eastport. ‘Being able to help’ To an outsider, it’s difficult to imagine why someone would become a CNA at a nursing home today. The median pay of $11.76 an hour is on par with many retail jobs and less than what wait staff at nice restaurants earn. Yet becoming a CNA requires far more training — 180 hours — at a cost of up to $1,100 in Maine. CNA pay has even gotten worse over time, both in Maine and nationally. Between 2005 and 2015, the median hourly wage for a CNA in Maine declined by 4 percent, adjusted for inflation.  While pay for CNAs and other direct care workers is low everywhere, it’s particularly bad in Maine, at the same time that patients have increasingly gotten sicker. Maine direct care workers made 15 to 25 percent less than their counterparts in neighboring states in 2015. As a result of poor wages, 53 percent of the workers in Maine rely on some form of public assistance to make ends meet, and 12 percent live below the federal poverty line, according to census data. The job is also dangerous: Nationally, CNAs are three-and-a-half times more likely to be injured on the job than the typical U.S. worker. In Maine, CNAs are injured as often as construction workers. It’s emotionally draining work, too. Most residents who enter a nursing home will die there, and it falls to the CNA to wash and dress the body. Often it’s the body of someone they’ve grown close to over months or years of providing care. Not surprisingly, many people burn out. It’s likely that more than half of CNAs will last less than a year, according to the American Health Care Association. But where some see an underpaid, grim and grueling job, Sawtelle sees an opportunity for meaning and stability. She grew up around nursing homes, since her mom, who singlehandedly raised Sawtelle and her sister, is a CNA. “I’d go with my mom to work, and be there all day and play games with the residents. It got my interest,” she said. “I really liked being there with them and being able to help.” Sawtelle got her CNA license while she was still in high school in the Oxford County town of Dixfield. At her first job, at a facility in Rumford, she came to know many residents better than members of her own family. She learned what and when they wanted to eat, how they preferred their hair parted, what colors they liked to wear and what scared them most. She helped them age and, eventually, die with grace. But these days, four years into her career as a CNA, there’s less time to get to know and help the people she’s responsible for ushering through the last phase of life. Sawtelle would like to eventually become a nurse, since at least then she would make a decent living. Nurses in Maine make almost three times what CNAs make, according to the Maine Department of Labor. “At the same time it’s not the same work. [As a nurse], you don’t have as much one-on-one time as you do as a CNA,” she said. “I would really miss that.” There’s no obvious path for Sawtelle to become a nurse at this point anyway, aside from taking out tens of thousands of dollars in loans to take courses on the weekend and at night, she said. ‘It’s never been this difficult’ Droves of baby boomers, particularly women, surged into the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s. The nursing home industry took advantage of the abundant labor and built itself on the assumption of high turnover. “There was a surplus of workers, and it didn’t matter if you kept someone for six or 12 months because as soon as she left there’d be 25 more people knocking on the door,” said Stephen Dawson, the founder of PHI, a research and advocacy organization focused on direct care workers. In addition, work done by women has historically been valued less than work done by men. As one recent study found, wages decrease as women join occupations that men once dominated, even after controlling for education, work experience, skills, race and geography. But while nursing homes could previously function by offering relatively low wages and accepting high turnover, it’s much harder today. Now when a CNA leaves, there often isn’t another one to fill her worn-out shoes. Across the state there are currently about 600 unfilled CNA positions in nursing homes alone, out of more than 3,000 CNAs statewide, according to Richard Erb, CEO and president of the Maine Health Care Association, a trade group representing 96 of Maine’s 103 nursing homes. Staffing concerns are now the No. 1 issue facing Maine nursing homes, said Erb. Kirby Whitney, the administrator of Stillwater Health Care where Sawtelle works, said he’d like to raise wages to attract more CNAs, but he can’t because, like most facilities, about 75 percent of Stillwater’s funding comes from MaineCare, the state’s version of Medicaid. And MaineCare reimbursements are chronically low. The average daily reimbursement rate for a MaineCare resident in 2015 was $202.83 per resident per day, according to Erb, which worked out to an average loss of $13.49 per resident per day. In lieu of raising wages, Stillwater Health Care and its parent company, First Atlantic, do what they can to make staff feel appreciated, Whitney said. They give a 2- or 3-percent raise each year. They offer partial tuition reimbursement if a CNA wants to take a health-related course. And they try to do small, inexpensive things to show they care: They give pins for every year an employee stays, regularly honor an employee of the month and host outdoor barbeques in the summer. But, Whitney said, “It’s a constant struggle, and it’s getting harder and harder each year.” ‘My breaking point’ Nursing homes are required by law to meet minimum staff-to-resident ratios, which means the CNAs who remain are shouldering a greater burden. They are being required to work extra shifts to maintain a ratio of one staff member for every five residents during the day, and one for every 15 at night, said Erb of the Maine Health Care Association. In addition, nursing homes are increasingly turning to agencies that provide temporary staff — at a marked up price. There was a 60-percent increase in the use of agency staffing between 2015 and 2016, according to the Maine Council on Aging. Most days Sawtelle works with at least one temporary CNA — a person who doesn’t know the facility or the residents. The good ones ask Sawtelle and the other long-term staff questions, Sawtelle said. The less motivated temporary workers leave her and others to pick up the slack. “They don’t know that this person needs to lay down. They don’t know that this person is continent or incontinent,” she said. “They don’t know any of that. So it’s extra work on us, telling them what to do.” Agency staff also get paid on average $5 or $6 an hour more than CNAs like Sawtelle who are employed by nursing homes, according to several CNAs and administrators. The higher pay is justified because their hours aren’t guaranteed and they are expected to be able to adapt to a variety of different nursing home environments. On Feb. 19, Sawtelle hit a low. Two of her CNA colleagues didn’t show up to work, so she was assigned to take care of 11 residents instead of her usual eight. (Even though she had more residents than normal, the number of staff spread out across the whole facility evened out to fit the required staffing ratio.) On top of the extra responsibility, she was working with agency staff who didn’t know the facility well. Several residents got angry with Sawtelle for taking longer than usual to get to them. A nurse badmouthed her for not being where the nurse thought she was supposed to be. “That was kind of my breaking point,” she said. “I don’t want to leave here. … But the stress that day, it made me sick to my stomach.” That night she went online to apply for other jobs. ‘They become like your family’ By 6:15 a.m. when Sawtelle started her shift on Feb. 28, Stillwater Health Care nursing home was already humming. Staff shuffled swiftly through the hallway. They wheeled carts with linens, delivered morning meds, and discussed the moods of the facility’s 63 residents. Sawtelle started her day by talking with the overnight staff to learn who slept poorly, who had diarrhea, who was feeling down. Then she began her morning rounds by waking up 94-year-old Priscilla Hunter. Hunter, who was a telegraph operator in Washington D.C., before moving back to her native Maine, smiled brightly when she saw Sawtelle. Sawtelle closed the door, removed Hunter’s robe and wiped her entire body with a wet cloth. She then carefully dressed Hunter in a bra, sweater and pants, while the two chatted about the sunny weather that was expected later in the day. Sawtelle doesn’t have to ask what any of her residents want to wear. By now she knows who likes to a wear a bra and who would rather go without, who needs special socks to prevent their ankles from swelling, who needs a diaper, who likes jewelry and who would prefer a scarf. Sawtelle then lifted Hunter by placing her arms underneath Hunter’s armpits, as if giving her an awkward hug, and hoisted her into her wheelchair. Hunter wheeled herself off into the hallway, where she would roam until breakfast. Before moving to the next resident, Sawtelle made Hunter’s bed. “This is their home. It’s important to keep it tidy, how I would want my home,” she explained. Before breakfast was served at 8 a.m., Sawtelle helped five more people get up and prepare for the day: Kay who wears a gold cross around her neck, Peg who loves Koalas, Marie who doesn’t like to brush her teeth with the door closed, Connie who requires two people and a machine called a Hoyer to lift her into her wheelchair because she is unable to bear weight, and Ora who is a paraplegic and still adjusting to his new life in the nursing home. And this was just one quarter of her day’s work. Six hours later, at the end of her shift, I sat down with Sawtelle and asked how the job affects her emotionally. Her face curled up. “It can be pretty emotional,” she said. She started to cry. “You get pretty attached to them, and they become like your family.” One of her favorite residents, Betty Ann, had died just a few days before, and Sawtelle hadn’t had a chance to process her death. Betty Ann had been a nurse, “So she knew what she wanted and was so friendly with everyone.” Betty Ann loved eyeshadow, beads and hats, Sawtelle said. Her favorite food was sausage, which she ate every morning. Sawtelle wiped her tears, finished her paperwork and drove home. She’d be back at 6:15 a.m. the next morning. For her work that day she made $90.96 before taxes. ‘Crucially important’ The most obvious short-term answer to the shortage of direct care workers is to raise their wages. That’s what an upcoming bill sponsored by Sen. Troy Jackson, a Democrat from Allagash, would do. LR 1387 proposes to raise wages for direct care staff in nursing homes by 10 percent in 2018 and another 10 percent in 2019. That would amount to a $1.14-per-hour raise next year for Sawtelle and a $1.25-per-hour raise the following year. If passed, it won’t be the first bill to affect CNA wages in recent years. In 2014, the legislature unanimously approved LD 1776, which required the state to reevaluate, and reset, nursing home reimbursement levels every two years. Prior to the bill’s passage, reimbursement rates had been based on 2005 expenditures. Wages increased marginally after the passage of LD 1776, said Erb, of the Maine Health Care Association. But the start of a statewide labor shortage has brought the industry back into​ crisis mode, and increases to the state’s minimum wage are expected to make CNA jobs comparatively less attractive. Before 2014, the problem was that state revenues were down, and the state didn’t know how to find the money to pay for nursing homes, Erb said. “Now the state budget is in better shape, but the tight labor market is the problem.” LR 1387 is different from LD 1776 in a number of ways. First, it targets not just nursing homes but all direct care employers — including home care agencies, adult day care and residential facilities. Second, it focuses entirely on increasing wages, as opposed to simply giving health care providers more money. LD 1387 includes a measure that’s known as a “wage pass-through,” said Erb. That means it allocates funds through Medicaid reimbursements for the express purpose of increasing compensation for direct care workers. Workers in states with pass-through programs earn as much as 12-percent more per hour than workers in other states after those programs are implemented, according to a 2010 research study published in Med Care, a journal of the American Public Health Association. A raise of 10 percent over two years would be “significant, especially for someone who’s making in the range of $20,000 a year,” said Howes, the Connecticut College economics professor. But legislative action to increase reimbursement rates and thereby allow nursing homes and home health agencies to raise wages may be only part of the solution. Direct care workers would also benefit from more opportunities for training and more rungs on the career ladder between front-line CNA and nurse, direct care advocates said. “A big problem in the long-term care labor structure is there are few positions between entry level aide position and the nursing level, which is at least a year if not two or four of college level math and science,” said Dawson.  In Maine, long-term care employers are recognizing this gap. “We are looking at creating more rungs in the ladder,” said Erb, of the Maine Health Care Association “We know there are a lot of people who want to enter the healthcare profession and we need to do more to help people move [from CNAs to nurses].”  Understanding how to close the gap is another matter — one no one in Maine has quite figured out. ‘I love this job’ After our interview, Sawtelle opened an envelope she’d been holding on her lap. It was from the administration — a small round pin that said “3 years of service,” a milestone she’d passed the month before. Along with the pin, she had gotten a 3-percent raise, or about 30 cents an hour more. Sawtelle affixed the pin to her name tag, next to her one- and two-year pins. Whether she’ll stay for her fourth year is not yet clear. “I love being here, I love this job, I love my residents,” she said. “The pay is not great, but I don’t want to leave.” She paused. “But I do want to leave at the same time.”Maine Focus is a journalism and community engagement initiative at the Bangor Daily News.
