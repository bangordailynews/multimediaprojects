		"extended_description" : "A word to summarize Maine in 2016? How about 'divided.' From a historic presidential election that saw the state cleave along party lines to a national monument that incited clashes about our state’s past, present and future, this year Maine only seemed to agree on disagreement. Marijuana was made legal, too, but only by the narrowest margin. Inflammatory, impassioned rhetoric from our elected leaders and literary giants, about politics, race, culture and crime, highlighted and amplified divisions within our state and country. Amid all this, though, unity was present if elusive. Maine was gripped by an arrest in a notable cold case murder. We mourned the boy who was lost, and reveled in a serpentine spectacle along the Presumpscot River. Together, we learned that deals for electricity aren’t as good as they seem, that state spending must be scrutinized so it goes where it belongs, and that pleasing distractions of winter in Portland and late summer in Bangor can leave to never return. We, again, mourned too many Mainers lost to heroin. The top stories of 2016, listed here, reflect these divisions, but not at the expense of the moments that united us. Over the coming year, here’s hoping to much more of the latter.",
