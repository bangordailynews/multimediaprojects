# Multimedia Projects
Repo for storing multimedia stories we've done at the BDN. To start a new multimedia project, use [the BDN APP generator](https://github.com/bangordailynews/BDNapps).

All projects will be added as sub-directories of this project. This repo doesn't store the compiled files, just the machine that makes the sausage.

If you need to recompile the file, you'll need to run npm and bower to get the components and then grunt build to rebuild the dist (which is then uploaded onto the server).
