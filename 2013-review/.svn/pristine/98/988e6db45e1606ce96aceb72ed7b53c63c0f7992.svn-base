The <a href='http://bangordailynews.com/2013/10/09/business/lac-megantic-inspired-maine-rail-review-finds-safety-adequate/'>inspections of Maine’s railway system</a> ordered by Gov. Paul LePage and the Federal Railroad Administration in the days after the rail disaster unearthed <a href='http://www.maine.gov/mdot/railsafetyreport/'>no significant safety flaws</a> in the state’s 1,150-mile system. But the ripple effects of the accident swamped Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway, a Hermon-based company that lost a total of 28 workers to layoffs between U.S. and Canadian operations after its train exploded. The <a href='http://bangordailynews.com/2013/08/07/business/railway-involved-in-quebec-crash-that-killed-47-files-for-bankruptcy/'>railway declared bankruptcy</a> and is <a href='http://bangordailynews.com/2013/12/13/business/wall-street-investment-firm-emerges-as-potential-buyer-of-montreal-maine-and-atlantic-railway/'>now for sale</a>. Meanwhile, people whose livelihoods were dependent on the railway are <a href='http://bangordailynews.com/2013/09/18/news/piscataquis/milo-area-businesses-feel-pain-as-bankrupt-railroad-struggles-to-survive/'>left facing an uncertain future</a>."

			"description" : "<p>When former Albion resident Christopher Knight -- the North Pond Hermit -- was arrested in April, the circumstances left more questions than answers. Knight told law enforcement he had lived in the woods of Rome, Maine, for 27 years without being detected. But how did he <a href='http://bangordailynews.com/2013/04/10/news/state/its-surreal-hes-surreal-officers-amazed-at-hermit-burglars-ability-to-survive-in-maine-woods-for-27-years/?ref=search'>survive</a>?
