			"description" : "<p>Maine’s stories of the year, 2013 edition, is equal parts tragedy and triumph, absurd and abhorrent, promising and provocative. Our political news was dominated by party clashes, a governor prone to bombast and a personal revelation by a figure long in the public eye. We shuddered at the news from Quebec and were staggered at the events of July Fourth. Maine’s economy improved slightly and health care got bigger, better and paid. And from dancing on the Bangor Waterfront, smoking pot in Portland and extreme camping near North Pond, the year that was brought a sense of wonderment and whimsy that should be tough to beat in 2014.</p>"
